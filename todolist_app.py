### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ###
# ** User Interface (UI) and Storage Method **
# - Build a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) that welcomes users 
# - Displays a menu with options to add, view, delete tasks, quit the application.
# => The tasks should be stored in a Python list

# ** Core Features **
# - Add tasks
# - View tasks
# - Delete tasks
# - Quit the application

# ** User Interaction **
# - Use input() to capture user selections and ensure proper input 
# validation to handle invalid choices.

# ** Error Handling **
# - Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch errors
# - Alert the user if they provide invalid input
# - Alert the user if there are no tasks to view
# - Alert the user if they try to delete a task that doesn't exist
# - Alert the user if they select an option on the main menu that doesn't exist

# ** Code Organization **
# - Organize your code into functions to improve clarity and maintainability. 
# - Use descriptive function names and add comments/docstrings where necessary.

# ** Testing and Debugging
# - Thoroughly test your application, considering edge cases
# such as empty lists and invalid input.
